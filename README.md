# TechnicPack Solder SDK for PHP

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/TechnicPack/SolderClient.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/TechnicPack/SolderClient)

The Solder SDK for PHP makes it easy for developers to access [Solder](https://github.com/technicpack/solder) services in their PHP code, and build robust 
applications and software that can interact with Solder. You can get started in minutes by installing the SDK through 
Composer.
